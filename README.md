// How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

     Using SDLC approaches, such as creating user stories, allows a developer to basically "read minds" with the users
     and determine what the user actually wants and needs in the software. The user stories create a background for the
     developer to create the functions that are needed to implement the needs of the user story.
     
// How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
     
     I am hoping to incorporate all of the agile processes into my future work. Since I have learned about Scrum-Agile
     methodologies, I am now looking at becoming a certified Scrum Master to diversify my employment opportunities. As
     far as developing programs, Using the idea of user stories to develop a software design document, then using that
     design document to create the software, is the way that I will be progressing in the future.
     
// What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  
     A good team member is someone who supports not only the development, but their other team members as well. A team 
     cannot be successful if the individual team members do not trust or support each other. This includes helping with
     code or design, Picking up work when someone is unable to do it, and trusting the other team members that they have
     your back when something goes wrong, and step in to help fix it. A good team member is also truthful, and admits
     when they have problems or did something wrong, and actively seeks out help when they need it, instead of hiding it
     and hoping they aren't noticed.
